## Project Overview
Welcome to the GitHub repository of the Amazon Prime Video Content Analytics with Power BI Dashboard. The dashboard highlights the total number of titles, ratings, genres, and directors, which are 9655, 25, 519, and 5771 respectively. It includes a bar chart of ratings by total shows categorized by age suitability, a bar chart of genres by total shows, a world map depicting the total shows by country, a donut chart comparing the proportion of movies to TV shows, and a line graph showing the total number of shows by release year. This dashboard illustrates the expansive and diverse content available on Prime Video, with a significant growth in the number of shows in recent years, a strong preference for movies over TV shows, and a variety of genres with drama being the most prevalent. The age rating distribution suggests a focus on content suitable for viewers aged 13 and above.
